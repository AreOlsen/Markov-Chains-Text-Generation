# MARKOV CHAINS TEXT GENERATION.

How would you create a tiny little story for your friends without having to write a giant neural network or having to do the tedious work of doing it by hand? Well, this is the tool for you!

Markov Chains are Monte Carlo algorithms that show weighted bias in probability concerning different nodes in a graph.
This little tool uses exactly the Markov Chains principles and creates a text generation system based on weighted probabilities. Create your own Sherlock Holmes story in 5 minutes!
