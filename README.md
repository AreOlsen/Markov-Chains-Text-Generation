# MARKOV CHAINS TEXT GENERATION.

How would you create a small little story for your friends without having to write a giant neural network nor having to do the tedious work of doing it by hand. Well, this is the tool for you!

Markov Chains are a Monte Carlo algorithms that shows weighted bias in probability concering different nodes in a graph.
This is a little tool that uses exactly the Markov Chains principles and creates a text generation system based on the weighted probabilities. Create your own Sherlock Holmes story in 5 minutes!
